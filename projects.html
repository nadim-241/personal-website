        <h1>Multithreaded Rust HTTP Server</h1>
        During my free time this summer, I decided I wanted to learn a bit of Rust. The language seemed cool, and
        everybody was talking about it (and who doesn't love the idea of never seeing a segfault again?). The server can
        handle serving PDF, HTML, CSS and JPG files (with the option to expand easily if I ever have the need for
        anything else), and is extremely lightweight and fast compared to a more fleshed out technology such as Node.js.
        Indeed it is even serving the text which you are reading right now!
        <br><br>
        Given that a simple webserver seemed like a fairly accomplishable project for a weekend, I decided to extend it
        by allowing it to handle concurrent requests (rather than just process them sequentially). While this probably
        isn't strictly necessary for such a low traffic site, it was a useful learning exercise, and gave me a better
        understanding of threadpools.
