        Hi! I'm Nadim. I'm a dedicated, driven student of computer science at the University of St Andrews, with a
        passion for software engineering. I enjoy finding <u>elegant</u>, <u>clean</u> solutions to complex real-world
        problems
        and am
        comfortable in a range of languages and frameworks.<br><br>

        When I'm not working or learning, I am a very active person. I cycle and run regularly, and I am training for
        the Ljubljana marathon this October. I have also devoted a lot of time to competitive target shooting, where
        have previously placed fourth in the UK and ~250th in the world. I love to travel, and have been lucky enough to
        spend my time outside of university visiting all sorts of beautiful places. I'd love to answer any questions
        from <a href="mailto:nadim.searight@gmail.com">my email</a>!
