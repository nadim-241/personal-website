        <h1>Work Experience</h1>
        <h1>Summer Placement Software Engineer 2024</h1>
        <h2>Leonardo, Edinburgh</h2>
        This summer I was excited to embark on a three month position as a software engineer at <a
            href="https://www.leonardo.com/en/">Leonardo</a>, a world leader in the aerospace and defence industry. I
        welcomed the experience with enthusiasm, and was able to apply my existing in-depth knowledge of C#.NET
        development and design patterns to bring enhanced robustness and clarity to existing code, while also getting to
        grips with developing WinUI3 applications, as opposed to the WPF ones which I am used to.<br><br>
        I particularly enjoyed getting to present my thoughts on the MVVM design pattern to my senior colleagues who had
        previously focused on C++ development, conveying the main advantages of the pattern succintly.

    <div class="aboutme">
        <h1>Software Engineer Summer Intern 2023</h1>
        <h2>Edge Energy, Westbury</h2>
        While at Edge Energy, I utilised C# and the WPF user interface framework to design several applications, the
        largest being a solution which allowed clients and employees to examine the data quality of a proprietary OFDM
        telemetry system, ensuring the system was operating optimally. <br><br>
        I also implemented a solution to allow engineers to service products in the field more effectively. This helped
        save company costs significantly, since the products no longer needed to be shipped back to the UK (accruing
        customs and shipping costs) for servicing.<br><br>
        This was my first experience of working to develop software for a real-world purpose (not just a hobby project I
        thought would be cool!) and it gave me invaluable insight into the thought process that goes on behind
        developing software for a company.
